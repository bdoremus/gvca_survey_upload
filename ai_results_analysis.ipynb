      "\n",
      "**Summary of Themes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Curriculum**\n",
      "   - **Consistency and Standards:** Parents seek uniform classroom and homework expectations across different teachers. There are concerns regarding the complexity of math curriculum and the introduction of multiple problem-solving methods.\n",
      "   - **Academic Rigor:** High academic standards are appreciated, especially in math, reading, writing, and classical subjects like Latin. While challenging, the workload is a source of stress and potential burnout.\n",
      "   - **Language Offerings:** Requests for additional language options, particularly Spanish, to enhance students' linguistic skills and future career prospects.\n",
      "   - **Support for Diverse Learning Needs:** Emphasis on providing adequate support for students with learning differences, such as ADHD, and appreciation for existing tutoring and homework help programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Teachers**\n",
      "   - **Quality and Dedication:** Teachers are highly praised for their commitment, care, and effectiveness in fostering students' academic and personal growth.\n",
      "   - **Inconsistencies and Training:** Concerns about inconsistent communication among teachers and the effectiveness in classroom management. Retention of quality teachers is also a worry.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Communication**\n",
      "   - **Timeliness and Clarity:** Need for improved and timely communication regarding school events, homework expectations, grading policies, and transitions between grade levels.\n",
      "   - **Platforms and Accessibility:** Suggestions to utilize more accessible communication methods beyond Facebook, such as integrating communication tools within the school's app.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Policies & Administration**\n",
      "   - **Carline and Pickup Procedures:** Significant concerns about the efficiency, safety, and organization of the carline system during drop-off and pick-up times.\n",
      "   - **Uniform and Dress Code:** Perception of uniform and dress code policies being overly restrictive with calls for more flexibility and clarity in enforcement.\n",
      "   - **Homework and Assessment Policies:** Requests for more consistent homework policies, especially regarding breaks during holidays and weekends, and clearer guidelines on grading practices and test retakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Culture & Virtues**\n",
      "   - **Alignment with Family Values:** Appreciation for the school's culture and emphasis on virtues aligning with family values, fostering respect, responsibility, and moral development.\n",
      "   - **Character Development:** Focus on character education and integration of virtues into daily activities are valued, though there are concerns about the fairness and criteria of virtue awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Wellbeing**\n",
      "   - **Student Stress and Mental Health:** The rigorous academic environment is causing stress and anxiety among students, with parents advocating for a better balance between academics and personal time.\n",
      "   - **Support Systems:** While existing support systems like tutoring are appreciated, there is a desire for more structured mental health support and interventions for struggling students.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Community**\n",
      "   - **Sense of Belonging:** Value placed on the strong sense of community among like-minded families and supportive relationships within the school.\n",
      "   - **Community Events:** Desire for more community-building events and opportunities for parent interaction and engagement beyond the classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Extra-curriculars & Sports**\n",
      "   - **Variety and Availability:** Requests for an expansion of extra-curricular activities, including more sports options, arts programs, and clubs to cater to diverse student interests.\n",
      "   - **Facilities for Activities:** Concerns about inadequate facilities for sports and outdoor activities, with suggestions for improvements to accommodate a broader range of activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Facilities**\n",
      "   - **Playgrounds and Recreational Spaces:** Requests for more playground space, separate cafeterias, and improved gymnasium facilities to enhance the physical environment for students.\n",
      "   - **Safety Enhancements:** Safety concerns related to traffic around school premises, efficiency of the carline, and overall school security measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Good Outcomes**\n",
      "    - **Academic and Personal Growth:** Satisfaction with the academic achievements and personal growth of children, praising the school's ability to prepare students for high school and beyond.\n",
      "    - **Long-term Benefits:** The classical education model is seen as beneficial in fostering critical thinking, moral character, and readiness for future educational and career challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Concern**\n",
      "    - **Bullying and Student Behavior:** Bullying remains a significant concern, with calls for more effective monitoring, intervention, and disciplinary measures.\n",
      "    - **Inconsistent Enforcement of Rules:** Worries about inconsistent application of rules and policies, leading to perceived favoritism and unfair treatment among students.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Other**\n",
      "    - **Technology Policies:** While the low-technology approach is generally praised, some parents suggest including specific tech-related classes like typing.\n",
      "    - **Safety Measures:** Additional safety measures, such as the presence of crossing guards and school resource officers, were mentioned as areas needing improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This comprehensive summary encapsulates the primary themes and concerns expressed by parents in the open-ended survey responses, organized according to the predefined categories and highlighting areas for potential improvement.\n"
